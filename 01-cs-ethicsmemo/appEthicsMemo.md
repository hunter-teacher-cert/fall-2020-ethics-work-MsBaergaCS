Ethics in Computer Science

To All Staff:

As you know, our union and the mayor have come to an agreement which will allow New York City Public Schools to open for in person instruction on September 21st.

We discussed last week the benefits and costs of the systemwide mandatory random testing program, scheduled to begin in October. While this will help us to better locate and isolate clusters of infections, it does not reach all school staff or students. To help mitigate this gap in assessment, we have asked both students and staff to check their temperature and consider whether they are experiencing any Covid symptoms before leaving for the building each morning.

Some members of the school staff have enquired about the possibility of using a Smartphone app to ask people to explicitly state whether they have done so, and whether they are experiencing any symptoms and, if so, what they are.

In an effort to ensure that we are implementing protocols which will keep us as safe as possible, I did do research  on the possibility of doing so.

My main concerns are as follows:

In the first place, not all students or members of staff have smartphones. It is easy to forget, in a time when even young children possess phones, that they aren't universal. Requiring use of something not everyone has access to is inequitable.

In addition, not all apps are HIPPA compliant. That means the data is not being tracked or held in accordance with standards for medical data.

Also, it is hard to know how apps will store and use the data they acquire.  For example, some apps explicitly indicate they will share this data with other parties. In using the app, we are giving up control to that data.  Whether it is used to help fight Covid or for profit, it is out of our hands to a large extent.

Think also about the permissions granted to the app. While the current version of the app lists the permissions below, note the fine print at the bottom of the screenshot which indicates that updates to the app may automatically add additional capabilities. Think about the implications of asking all students and staff to carry on their person an app that tracks their movements. This is not something that I can condone. It is a personal choice and not one that I, in good conscience, can get behind. We do not know how this data will be used, whether given to the government, to law enforcement organizations, or sold for profit.

Another thing to consider is the source of the app, which could be a health insurance company,  using the data to increase their profits or to better understand consumers, in addition to providing Covid screenings.

For these reasons, I have elected not to incorporate the use of a mandatory screening app in our protocols.

My priority is to keep everyone as safe as possible during these difficult times. However, the rights of individuals matter as well. If you have additional questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Best,
Ms B
