Slack; an App Review

Dear Principal S,

I'm writing to follow up with information regarding our discussion about the Slack app, as a possible supplement for our students to communicate during remote learning. As we discussed, I have a great deal of experience with Slack, having used it in the workplace at DOE Central, as well as in educational settings, such as professional development and college programs.

DESCRIPTION:
The app itself is marketed as a "workplace productivity tool". In practice, it allows group chat areas to be created for focused topics, to which users can individually opt in or out of. These channels can be created, but this functionality can be turned off for all or for individual users by administrators. The app also allows for direct messages between users, or groups of users, which cannot be viewed by administrators. The app is useful as it allows organization of topic-based discussions, provides a useful search feature, as well as the ability to pin content for later use/review. Users can be contacted on their devices, without needing to give up private information, like cell phone numbers. It allows for notification based on username or based on topics of interest to the user. The app also has settings to turn notifications off and on automatically based on designated times.

PRIVACY POLICY:
The App's privacy policy states that: Slack collects and receives customer data in the following ways.

Customer Data is given to Slack during creation (such as name, email address, workplace, etc), usage data and metadata, including "Slack logs the Workspaces, channels, people, features, content and links you view or interact with, the types of files shared, and what Third Party Services are used (if any)."

Log data is taken, such as: Internet Protocol (IP) address, the address of the web page visited before using the Website or Services, browser type and settings, the date and time the Services were used, information about browser configuration and plugins, language preferences and cookie data.

Device info is taken, as Slack actively collects info about the device being used by the individual using Slack. Whether it is a phone, tablet, laptop, desktop. What OS is used, and even information about the device settings.

Location data is taken as well. This may come from the individual using it or from the organization who created the Slack Workspace that was joined. For example, if we, as a school tell Slack, during creation, that we are a High School located in Brooklyn, Slack, by extension attaches this information to the users who join it. The user may input a location upon creation of the account, if the app is connected to 3rd parties, for example, Google, they may be able to infer information from that party. An IP address received from your browser or device might help Slack to determine approximate location. Slack may also collect location information from devices in accordance with the consent process provided by the individual device being used.

The App uses Cookies, which means that info about other sites visited will be brought back to Slack.

Contact information is also attached to Slack, as Slack allows in-app calls.

USAGE:
Slack indicates that this information will be used to help provide and develop learning and productivity tools and features. To interact with you. To investigate security issues and to help prevent them. To conduct account management and billing.

RETENTION OF DATA:
Slack indicates that they will keep data based on instructions given by the user. Slack maintains that the plan level will allow customization of data retention on different levels (ie base on the individual user's preferences, as opposed to workspace-level).  

PERMISSIONS:
The App, as installed with default permissions, has the following permissions.

Camera: Take pictures and videos
Contacts: read contacts, find accounts on device
Microphone: can record audio
Phone: can read status and identity
Storage: can modify or delete SD card contents, can read contens of shared storage.
Other: runs foreground service, controls vibration, runs at startup, have full network access, uses biometric hardware, views network connections, prevents phone from sleeping, Plays install referrer API, use fingerprint hardware, can use full screen, change audio settings, pair with Bluetooth devies, and can receive data from the internet.

In general, the App itself does not provide a very clear indication of how the data in question will be used. It is apparent that there is some level of control. Certain locations have protections in place for users, such as the EU, the UK, Ireland, and California. The United States, more generally, and New York, more specifically, do not have enhanced privacy protections in place.

After reading the privacy policy, it is important to know that the app indicates that there is an age restriction on usage, although I do not recall seeing that mentioned when it was set up. Specifically, Slack notes that "Slack does not allow use of our Services and Websites by anyone younger than 16 years old." They request that individuals who are known to be under 16 and using Slack "unlawfully" should be reported, so that their data can be deleted.

Given this and given the lack of clarity with respect to their privacy policy, Slack should not be downloaded by our younger students. It may be reasonable to allow students who are Seniors and who are in our Advanced Placement courses to access Slack. This has two benefits, as far as I can see. For one, Slack itself requires a level of maturity and restraint. The 16 and older requirement dovetails nicely with this. It also has the benefit of introducing it to the students who are likelier to encounter it, as they approach college and/or the workforce, beforehand.

EULA: Slack's TOS indicate they give the Customer, for them this is defined as the creator of the Workspace, the control over messages and files. They state: Customer may exclusively provide us with instructions on what to do with (the messages and files). They indicate that the Customer (in this case, that would be the school) will (a) inform Authorized Users of all Customer policies and practices that are relevant to their use of the Services. And further, they state that data is the responsibility of the school, when it is in our possession. With respect to owning content, Slack contends that Customer owns it's own data but grants Slack "grants us and the Slack Extended Family a worldwide, non-exclusive, limited term license to access, use, process, copy, distribute, perform, export and display Customer Data, and any Non-Slack Products created by or for Customer, only as reasonably necessary (a) to provide, maintain and update the Services; (b) to prevent or address service, security, support or technical issues; (c) as required by law or as permitted by the Data Request Policy; and (d) as expressly permitted in writing by Customer."

In summary, the app itself does seem appropriate for student use. The app seems to primarily make money based on selling a subscription service. While the unpaid version does offer access to some of Slack's functionality, such as access to 10,000 of your teamâ€™s most recent messages, 1 to 1 calling, and 10 3rd party integrations,  it does not offer full functionality. And that lack will be felt by a team of any significant size, because of the restrictions on message-amount. More advanced versions offer unlimited access to messages, secure collaboration with group-calling features, and even HIPAA-compliant data storage and usage.

I would be comfortable using it myself, and, indeed, I have been comfortable doing so I do wonder somewhat about the extent of the location data being provided by 3rd party apps. For instance, by attaching Google Drive to Slack, am I giving access to all of Google's information on me? By signing in with Google am I doing so? Does this give location data? Does it give search history? However, ultimately, and especially compared to the alternatives which require hosting of servers or, like discord, which do not allow channels for organization, Slack does seem a beneficial app. Slack seems comparatively less intrusive than many of the apps currently on the phones of students and for that reason I do not think most students would object to having it on their phones (with the caveats that they do not like wasting space, or their data, in my experience).
